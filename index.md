# CSCI 235 - Software Analysis and Design II 
# Fall 2018


The primary focus of this course is the **design and analysis of algorithms and abstract data types**. To this end it introduces elementary data structures with related algorithms and their use in problem solving. The course also covers core computer science concepts such as abstraction, algorithm complexity, performance analysis and the tradeoffs between running time, storage size, clarity and extensibility that are at the core of software design. As a sequel to CSCI 135 it will also enhance your programming skills in C++ by introducing new tools such as Templates, Inheritance, Polymorphism, extend your understanding of pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

# Announcements:

**8/31/2018** I re-arranged the topics/reading in the schedule for lectures 5-9. Changes are also reflected in the syllabus, please get the updated version if you are referring to the syllabus for the schedule.

**8/30/2018** In C++, .h and .hpp extensions are the same (interchangable). Once you have named your interface file, however, you must use the exact file name and extension in your #include statements. **For Project 1, the files on Gradescope are named Customer.hpp and GeniusBar.hpp, so please use *#include "Customer.hpp"* and *#include "GeniusBar.hpp* in your submission.** Thank you!

**8/30/2018** My CUNYfirst account is locked and I cannot access Blackboard for now. Please keep an eye on these announcements regularly for important communications. Thank you!

**8/30/2018** **Postponed Project_1 due date to 9/6**, as well as all future projects accordingly

**8/30/2018** Email update: the alias (ligorio.tiziana) for my hunter email doesn't seem to be working. Please use tligorio@hunter.cuny.edu

**8/30/2018** I posted a flash intro to Object Oriented Programming along with Project 1 in the table below. Those of you who are confused about Project 1 and the basics of writing classes may find this helpful.
